Early Italian Renaissance art began to emerge in Florence during the first decade of the 15th century.  Florentine and other Tuscan artists such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello, Masaccio and Andrea Mantegna, instigated a series of discoveries and improvements in all the visual arts (architecture, sculpture, painting), which effectively revolutionized the face of public and private art in Italy and beyond. Although it eventually spread throughout Italy, the Early Renaissance was centered on Florence and patronized by the Florentine Medici family.
