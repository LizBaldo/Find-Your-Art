Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance. In their palette, they used included intense and warm colors. In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures. In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.
